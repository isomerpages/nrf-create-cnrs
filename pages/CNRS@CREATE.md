# About CNRS@CREATE

[**Singapore: the CNRS opens CNRS@CREATE, its first overseas subsidiary**](http://www.cnrs.fr/en/singapore-cnrs-opens-cnrscreate-its-first-overseas-subsidiary)

The French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) strengthened its presence in Singapore by integrating the CREATE Campus of the NRF. CNRS Chairman and CEO Antoine Petit inaugurated CNRS@CREATE on 25 June 2019. It is CNRS’ first overseas subsidiary. It works with Singapore’s universities, research institutions, and CREATE’s international partners to conduct research and application of technologies in areas that are relevant to Singapore’s social and economic needs.  

“CNRS is the first research organisation to be part of CREATE, and we look forward to a fruitful collaboration”, says Jean-Yves Marzin, Chairman of CNRS@CREATE.

**CNRS@CREATE goals:**

*   to strengthen France and Singapore’s global position in the areas of research of the highest potential for present and future society.
*   to create unique initiatives in transdisciplinary research of excellence and technology development which would not exist under normal circumstances or within a single country or institution.

*   to support translational research and innovation for promoting exploitation of research results. Direct industry participation in research projects is encouraged to ensure efficient transformation of research results into innovative products






========

Our objective is to build CNRS@CREATE as a trans-continental hub for research with unique opportunities for high quality faculty, researchers and postgraduate/postdoctoral students. "CNRS@CREATE Ltd also represents an additional tool for the CNRS in its transfer policy, while CREATE promotes the development of research programs that generate value through intellectual property and the creation of start-ups, a technology transfer that can be supported by French industrials, which are widely present in Singapore", comments the subsidiary's director.

CNRS@CREATE will serve the following purposes:

*   to strengthen France and Singapore's global position in the areas of research of the highest potential for present and future society.
*   to create unique initiatives in transdisciplinary research of excellence and technology development which would not exist under normal circumstances or within a single country or institution.
*   to support translational research and innovation for promoting exploitation of research results. Direct industry participation in research projects is encouraged to ensure efficient transformation of research results into innovative products

As an interdisciplinary, agile and responsive system, this first CNRS subsidiary is at the heart of CNRS's new international strategy. This promising model could give the organization new ambitions. For Patrick Nédellec, "CNRS@CREATE Ltd allows us to develop new know-how. I see it as a pilot operation that can be transferred to other countries ready to invest massively, such as Singapore”.
