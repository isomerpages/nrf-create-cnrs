# About CNRS@CREATE

[**Singapore: the CNRS opens CNRS@CREATE, its first overseas subsidiary**](http://www.cnrs.fr/en/singapore-cnrs-opens-cnrscreate-its-first-overseas-subsidiary)

The French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) strengthened its presence in Singapore by integrating the CREATE Campus of the NRF. CNRS Chairman and CEO Antoine Petit inaugurated CNRS@CREATE on 25 June 2019. It is CNRS’ first overseas subsidiary. It works with Singapore’s universities, research institutions, and CREATE’s international partners to conduct research and application of technologies in areas that are relevant to Singapore’s social and economic needs.  

“CNRS is the first research organisation to be part of CREATE, and we look forward to a fruitful collaboration”, says Jean-Yves Marzin, Chairman of CNRS@CREATE.

**CNRS@CREATE goals:**

*   to strengthen France and Singapore’s global position in the areas of research of the highest potential for present and future society.
*   to create unique initiatives in transdisciplinary research of excellence and technology development which would not exist under normal circumstances or within a single country or institution.

*   to support translational research and innovation for promoting exploitation of research results. Direct industry participation in research projects is encouraged to ensure efficient transformation of research results into innovative products

DesCartes Program aims to develop disruptive hybrid AI to serve the smart city and to enable optimized decision-making in complex situations, encountered for critical urban systems.

The program is composed of 10 work packages, allocated to three pillars:

* A first pillar revolving around “Intelligent Computing”. Its aim is to develop computer science tools to manage smart data and produce certified and explainable hybrid twins and controllers, based on physical / knowledge-aware models.

* A second pillar focused on “empowering people in Smart societies”, which studies the collaborative process of decision making between human operators and the Hybrid AI; develops natural language front-ends for more natural operators-HAI interaction; develops ethical guidelines for policymakers and HAI designers; develops a minimal set of guidelines for the legal regulation of and policy development for implementing Hybrid AI; studies the overall integration and co-development processes of DesCartes.

* A third pillar dedicated to engineering and builders which brings the engineering, technological, and application dimensions to the concept of HAI. It aims at proposing operational methodology and architecture, from smart sensing and predictive diagnostics to robust and scalable control, for critical and complex system-of-systems.

Program director: Professor Francisco Chinesta.
