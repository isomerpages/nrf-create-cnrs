About CNRS@CREATE

[Singapore: the CNRS opens CNRS@CREATE, its first overseas subsidiary](http://www.cnrs.fr/en/singapore-cnrs-opens-cnrscreate-its-first-overseas-subsidiary)

The French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) has strengthened its presence in Singapore by partnering the Campus for Research And Technological Enterprise (CREATE) of the National Research Foundation (NRF).  CNRS@CREATE Ltd, which is CNRS’ first overseas subsidiary, will work with Singapore’s universities, research institutions, and CREATE’s international partners to conduct research and application of technologies in areas that are relevant to Singapore’s social and economic needs. Its inauguration took place in the presence of CNRS Chairman and CEO Antoine Petit on 25 June 2019.

With four International Research Laboratories located in Singapore, the CNRS benefits from a large scientific presence within the country. “Asia is a scientific driving force with several poles, including Singapore,” says Patrick Nédellec, Director of the Europe of Research & International Cooperation Department of the CNRS (DERCI). After setting up a representative office in Asia in 2014, the following year the CNRS organized a major conference bringing together all its laboratories in Asia.  “For our Singaporean partners, this was proof of CNRS’s investment in Singapore. “, he emphasizes. “ With the support of NRF, the first CNRS subsidiary abroad: CNRS@CREATE Ltd, was created” adds Dominique Baillargeat, its Scientific Executive Director.

Designed as a program operator to build and to conduct large transdisciplinary research programs, CNRS@CREATE Ltd is therefore integrated into CREATE. The latter develops international research collaborations through massive funding of major programs carried out between internationally renowned university partners. “ CNRS is the first research organisation to be part of CREATE, and we look forward to a fruitful collaboration”, says Jean-Yves Marzin, director of the CNRS Institute of Engineering Sciences and Systems (INSIS), and in charge for the CNRS of the CNRS@CREATE program.
